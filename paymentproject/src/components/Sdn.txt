ALPHABETICAL LISTING OF SPECIALLY DESIGNATED NATIONALS AND BLOCKED
PERSONS ("SDN List"):



This publication of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control
("OFAC") is designed as a reference tool providing actual notice of
actions by OFAC with respect to Specially Designated Nationals and
other persons (which term includes both individuals and entities)
whose property is blocked, to assist the public in complying with
the various sanctions programs administered by OFAC.  The latest
changes to the SDN List may appear here prior to their publication
in the Federal Register, and it is intended that users rely on
changes indicated in this document.  Such changes reflect official
actions of OFAC, and will be reflected as soon as practicable in
the Federal Register under the index heading "Foreign Assets
Control."  New Federal Register notices with regard to Specially
Designated Nationals or blocked persons may be published at any
time.  Users are advised to check the Federal Register and this
electronic publication routinely for additional names or other
changes to the SDN List.
